## Getting Started

To get started with the DApp, follow these steps:

**Note**: This application runs on the Base Sepolia Test Network. You need to hold test ETH on this network for gas fees. Visit the [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia) if you don't have test ETH. read through the following instructions if you have issues switching to the test network.

1. **Access the DApp**: Visit [sentry-verse.netlify.app](https://sentry-verse.netlify.app).
2. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure you have a compatible wallet (such as MetaMask) installed and connected to the Base Sepolia test network. If you are having issues switching your network, read this article: [Connect to Base Sepolia Network](https://revoke.cash/learn/wallets/add-network/base-sepolia).
3. **Visit Faucet**: To perform tasks on the application, you need to hold SVE (Sentry Verse Tokens). After successfully switching to the Base Sepolia Network, copy and paste your EVM wallet address (Ethereum wallet address) into the faucet and claim tokens. Visit [sentry-verse-faucet.netlify.app](https://sentry-verse-faucet.netlify.app/).
4. **Participate in Voting**: Once verified, you can participate in the voting processes available on the DApp.
5. **Verify Identity**: Complete the identity verification process on the platform.
